    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>  3/4 cup hoisin sauce  </li>
        <li>  1 cup shredded cabbage </li>
        <li>  1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced</lit>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step</h3>
    <p>  Put the rack of spareribs into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in the hoisin sauce, close the bag and toss gently to coat.
         Put the bag into a bowl and marinate the ribs in the refrigerator for 3 hours or up to overnight.  </p>

    <p>Put the ribs into a sheet pan along with all the marinade. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, slide it into the oven and bake until the meat easily separates from the bone, about 2 hours. Baste them every 30 minutes during the cooking process. Remove the ribs from the oven and let them rest. </p>
